## How to use this project?

Nice problem.  

You must fetch the repo to your project folder. and then, in `CmakeLists.txt` of your project (not this project),
add these codes below:
```cmake

```

First, compile the project:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCW_KATA_ARM=0
make
```

and you can see the definition `-DCW_KATA_ARM=0`, this option is for ARM(or Embedded System)
you can open [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) and find "CW_KATA_ARM", change options in it.
and run in "build" folderðŸ‘‡:
```bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCW_KATA_ARM=1
make
```
OK, all libs were compiled and move to "lib" folder in root path.

Now, copy all libs to your own project.  
Oh, don't forget copy each "include" folder in "src" folder to your project.

And if you want, you can run main in "bin" folder to test all functions of this project.
